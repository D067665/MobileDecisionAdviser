instruction=The Mobile Technology Decision Advisor, which is intended to provide a basis for discussion and, based on its functions, to enable far-reaching architectural decisions to be made. It offers the possibility to familiarize yourself with the application on the basis of a pre-defined evaluation. The information in the first tab Application has no effect on subsequent calculations and is only used to identify the individual evaluations or their completion. In the individual areas Client, Synchronization and Backend, you can use the selection menus and buttons for their weighting to influence the calculation results in the footer and on the overview. Each area has its own evaluation, which results in a recommendation that is listed in the overview as an overall picture.
